	<p class="subtext">ChicagoVeg Cooking is all about tasty plant-based food, sharing knowledge and cooking experiences between members, educating each other about the many benefits of veg*n cooking and how to make it fun, and of course about making new like-minded friends!</p>

<p class="subtext">While we have a broad scope including Vegetarian, Vegan Cooked, and Raw/Living Vegan Food, we will mostly focus on a general whole food vegan diet as the source of tasty food and a healthy lifestyle. It has been shown by numerous research studies* that an appropriately planned vegan diet may prevent and reverse such devastating health problems such as Heart Disease, Cancer, and Diabetes, to name a few. What else can we wish from our food if not a combination of being tasty, healthy, and fun?!</p>

<p class="subtext">ChicagoVeg Cooking is an extension of ChicagoVeg – Community for Chicagoland Vegetarians, Vegans, Raw Foodists, and their friends. It was born as a joint venture between ChicagoVeg and Lincoln Park WholeFoods Wellness Club (previous pilot program) to spread and popularize the vegan diet in the Chicago area.</p>

<p class="subtext">We welcome everyone: vegetarians, vegans, raw foodists, or ANYONE who is interested in tasty and healthy plant-based cooking to join us! </p>
